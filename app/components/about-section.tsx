        <p>
          I have a rich and versatile work background, which includes extensive responsibilities in sales and marketing
          where I gained knowledge within business development and customer-oriented services as well as strategic
          management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked in organizations like Continental Trading Enterprises (authorized distributor of OTIS elevator
          in Nepal), Asian Paints Nepal, and Goyal Metal Industries, adding value to each organization. I've
          transitioned from using spreadsheet applications to more advanced tools, earning certifications in Power BI
          and Databricks while developing my SQL skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to leverage my analytical abilities and educational background to gather valuable and usable
          information that can help determine strategic business performance. I enjoy working with lively teams and
          solving complex data-related problems.

// This is a placeholder for the favicon configuration
// The actual favicon will be generated during build time or manually added to the public folder
// For now, we'll use a simple configuration that works with a circular favicon

// This file is intentionally left empty as the favicon is configured in layout.tsx
// and the actual favicon.ico file should be placed in the public folder
